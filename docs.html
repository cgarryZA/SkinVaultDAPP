      <h1>SkinVault Documentation</h1>

      <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>SkinVault is a CS2 skin tracker fund, designed to provide an easy path to skin investing.
          The Value of this vault is tracked using SKINDEX, an Ethereum based ERC-20 token.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="tokenomics">
        <h2>Tokenomics</h2>
        <p>
          SKINDEX is minted when the user deposits Ethereum into the SkinVault SmartContract.
          This SKINDEX is minted at a rate determined by the Vault.
          The rate is Total Assets minus the Mint Fee and Dev Fee.
        </p>
        <p>
          SKINDEX can be burned at any time to release the value stored in the Vault.
          This is calculated as NAV - Burn Fee.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fees for the SkinVault SmartContract are adjustable but have maximum values set in the SmartContract.
          The mint and burn fees are to encourage net asset flow into the Vault.
          The burn fee is to discourage Vault withdrawals and encourage trading the token on exchanges.
          The dev fee is to provide funds for continued development and other costs of running the project.
          These fees are adjustable with the view of the burn fee being decreased as the Vault grows in value.
          The current fees can be found on the mint page or via interacting with the SmartContract.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="architecture">
        <h2>System Architecture</h2>
        <p>
          The SmartContract maintains several "Pools".
          The largest of these is the Skin Pool which is the system of steam accounts which hold the skins.
          The next largest is the BTC reserve, this is to ensure liquidity for withdrawals to buffer between the Eth Pool and the Skin Pool.
          Without the BTC reserve the user would have to wait for the sale of skins in the Vault before they recieved their Eth.
          The smallest pool is the Eth Pool. This too acts as liquidity for withdrawals to act as a buffer between the BTC Pool and the withdrawal.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="trading-bot">
        <h2>Trading Bot Infrastructure</h2>
        <p>
          The system of steam accounts hold the Counter Strike skins.
          When a deposit or burn action is made to the smart contract, the trading program activates.
          This checks the current inventory of the Vault and decides which skins are under or over-represented.
          Buy orders are created for under-represented skins and sell orders are created if any skins are over-represented by a significant amount.
          This ensures the investment strategy is followed.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="valuation">
        <h2>Valuation</h2>
        <p>
        The value of the Vault is defined as the sum of all the Pools. The value in Eth and BTC are determined from market prices.'
        The value of the Skins is determined by Pricempire.

            Q: What Prevents this project from being Rugged
          </p>
          <p>
            A: The SKINDEX token is only minted when ETH is deposited to the contract and is burned when ETH is released.
              There is no existing supply for someone to dump causing a classic rug pull. If a major holder were to burn
              a large quantity of SKINDEX the contract would pause when the BTC and ETH Pools were empty and would wait for
              The sale of skins equal to the value of SKINDEX burnt. This means the price of existing SKINDEX stays the same.
              For example if half the supply of SKINDEX was burnt, half the value of the vault would be sent to the burner,
              but the supply of SKINDEX would be halved so the price of SKINDEX would stay the same.
